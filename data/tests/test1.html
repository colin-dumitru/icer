				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Assess the overall effectiveness of the <strong>U play3D application</strong> for users who want to view music charts and create playlists based on them;</li>
					<li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>playlists and player management</strong>;</li>
					<li>Have an evidence of the users that used the available Tutorial in order to do this task and ask them if it was helpful;</li>  
					<li>Evaluate the time it takes users to add songs to a playlist.</li>
					<li>Test if the terminology and the labels make the application easy and clear to use;</li>
					<li>Test the systems response time</li>	
					<li>Use the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/#references">References</a> to guide you in writing your objectives.</li>

		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p><b>1. </b> The user wants to create a playlist based on a chart.</p>
			<p><b>2. </b> In order to accomplish this, he accesses the application and logs in using his Google account.</p>
			<p><b>3. </b> After authentication, the user navigates to the "Chart" section and opens the chart for May 25th 2013.</p>
			<p><b>4. </b> After that, he adds the top three songs to a new playlist.</p>
			<p><b>5. </b> For each of the three songs added to the playlist, he searches for similar ones.</p>
			<p><b>6. </b> The user adds to the newly created playlist three similar songs from each search session.</p>
			<p><b>7. </b> He then plays the playlist.</p>
			<p><b>8. </b> The user rearranges the songs from the currently playing playlist so that the last three songs become the first three.</p>
			<p><b>9. </b> He then creates a new radio station using one of the songs added to the playlist.</p>

					</ol>
                <div>Total Time: 3:10</div>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>			
					<ul>
						<li>Question 1: How easy was it for you to open the desired chart?</li>
						<li>Question 2: How easy was it for you to add songs to a playlist?</li>
						<li>Question 3: Did you find the available tutorial helpful in performing this tasks?</li>
						<li>Question 4: Was the terminology understandable for you?</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

		<p>A successful design has been achieved when:</p>

			<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
            <h6>User 1</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>No difficulties had, apart from identifying the correct section.</li>
                <li>No problems had.</li>
                <li>Some sections of the tutorial were confusing and didn't help much in completing the tasks.</li>
                <li>The charts section.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>User 2</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Finding the date picker for the charts was confusing. Also, there were too many options for choosing
                    the date of the chart.
                </li>
                <li>No problems had.</li>
                <li>
                    The tutorial contained too many sections and information which needed to be absorbed quickly, which
                    might make new users abandon the tutorial half way or skip it entirely (which is a problem as the
                    website is not intuitive without closely following the tutorial).
                </li>
                <li>The radio sections and what a custom criteria is.</li>
            </ol>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
			<h5>Test Observations</h5>
			<p>
                The general feedback from the users with their first contact with the application is that the general
                navigation is confusing without closely reading the tutorial.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, almost all users struggled with the radio section, by either not finding what a radio criteria is,
                how to add it, or what the actual radio is.
            </p>
		</div>
		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>
			<p>
                As most of the users struggled with the tutorial, we could clarify to the user that the general
                workflow of the application might be confusing for first time users if they do not follow the tutorial
                closely. We should also add an option to re-take the tutorial if the users find that they are struggling
                with a particular task.
            </p>
            <p>
                A slight redesign of the radio page is also needed to make adding criteria more intuitively.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the users suggested that we should change the icon of the play button when paused, as the current
                approach (making the button transparent) is not obvious enough and the standard pause symbol (two vertical
                bars) is more appropriate.
