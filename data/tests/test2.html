                <h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they
                        are thinking, about the task or the product/application;
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
                    <li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
                        sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
                        Observations section accompanied by video/audio).
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
                        "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".
                    </li>

                <li>The most confusing operation was resetting the radio to the default settings.</li>
                <li>No problems had.</li>
                <li>The manner in which the options for the songs is displayed (clicking and holding over the
                    desired image) is confusing and hard to find without first reading the tutorial.
                </li>
                <li>All terms were clear for these tasks.</li>

                <li>
                    Struggled a bit with finding the rest option for the radio, but generally no issues had.
                </li>
                <li>Very easy.</li>
                <li>
                    It isn't an intuitive gesture if you do not read the tutorial beforehand

            <h5>Test Observations</h5>
            <p>
                As for the previous test, the general workflow of the radio section is confusing and some terminology
                such as criteria or default criteria is not intuitive. The users also depend too much on the tutorial,
                as some gestures are not intuitive and not easily discoverable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="otherDetails">
            <h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>
            <p>
                We should try to adopt more conventional gestures and idioms, even if we have to sacrifice usability
                to make the general workflow more intuitive and discoverable even if the user has partially read the
                tutorial or skipped it entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                A suggestion from a user is to change how the options menu is displayed for a song in the "now playing"
                bar, by moving away from the long press gesture to a hover effect (displaying the song options - delete
                and delete all only when a user hovers the song).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another suggestion from a user was to slightly change how we focus on certain elements of the page
                during the tutorial, by moving from a red highlight to a zoom effect over the desired regions. We feel
                this might cause confusion to some users if the shape of some elements is changed, and most likely
                will not be implemented.
