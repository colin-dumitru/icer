            <ul>
                <li>Assess the overall effectiveness of the <strong>U play3D application</strong> for users who want to
                    manage their playlists and the selection of currently playing songs;
                </li>
                <li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>playlists and player management</strong>;</li>
                <li>Have an evidence of the users that used the available Tutorial in order to do this task and ask them
                    if it was helpful;
                </li>
                <li>Evaluate the time it takes users to delete a playlist, a song from a playlist, a search session, a
                    song from the player.
                </li>
                <li>Test if the terminology and the labels make the application easy and clear to use;</li>
                <li>Test the systems response time</li>
                <li>Use the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/#references">References</a> to
                    guide you in writing your objectives.

            <h5>Scenario</h5>
            <ol>
                <li> The user wants to clean up his playlists collection.</li>
                <li>To accomplish this, he accesses the application via his Google account. He enters his credentials in
                    the login page.
                </li>
                <li>After authentication, the main menu of the application is visible, including the "Playlist"
                    section.
                </li>
                <li>The user navigates to his first created playlist and decides to delete it, since his music taste has
                    evolved.
                </li>
                <li>He then picks another playlist and realizes that one of the songs does not go well with the rest of
                    them. He deletes that song.
                </li>
                <li>Because he wants his playlist to have a specific number of songs and he has deleted one, he picks
                    another song from the playlist and searches for similar songs.
                </li>
                <li>From the similar songs he adds one to the playlist, then deletes the created search session.</li>
                <li>He plays the playlist.</li>
                <li>He deletes from the player the first song.</li>

                <h5>Tasks</h5>

                <p>Write out the tasks for each persona type. <strong>Avoid complex tasks.</strong> Make sure the user
                    is able to complete the test in the specified time interval. Assign an estimated completion time for
                    each task.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Authentication: <span>30 s</span>;</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the first playlist and delete it <span>30 s</span>;</li>
                    <li>Delete a song from a playlist: <span>10 s</span></li>
                    <li>Search for a song similar to one from the previous playlist: <span>10 s</span></li>
                    <li>Add a similar song from the results to the playlist: <span> 20 s </span></li>
                    <li>Delete the created search session: <span>10 s</span></li>
                    <li>Play the previously modified playlist: <span>10 s </span></li>

                <h5>Post-test Questions</h5>

                <p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Question 1: How easy was it for you to navigate through existing playlists?</li>
                    <li>Question 2: Did you find the available tutorial helpful in performing this tasks?</li>
                    <li>Question 3: Was the terminology understandable for you?</li>

                <h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they
                        are thinking, about the task or the product/application;
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
                    <li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
                        sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
                        Observations section accompanied by video/audio).
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
                        "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".
                    </li>

                <p>
                    The users have become more fluent in the application workflow, which became apparent in how
                    easily they completed the tasks in the allotted time. It became apparent to us that the learning
                    curve of the application isn't as steep as previously thought, and with the proper improvement of
                    the initial tutorial, to make features and gestures more apparent, the user can become productive
                    in the application in a relative short time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only issue consistent with the users was the term "Search Session", and we might need a way to
                    devise a better way for the user to understand how to search and navigate through previous search
                    results.

                <h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>

                <p>
                    As with previous tests, the users struggled with certain tasks which were explained during the
                    initial tutorial. Most of the users complained that there was too much information to take in
                    all at once, and we might have to split the tutorial into sub-parts to give the user less
                    information to take in at any given time.
