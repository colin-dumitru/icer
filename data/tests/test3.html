				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Assess the overall effectiveness of the <strong>U play3D application</strong> for users who want to manage their playlists and the selection of currently playing songs;</li>
					<li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>playlists and player management</strong>;</li>
					<li>Have an evidence of the users that used the available Tutorial in order to do this task and ask them if it was helpful;</li>  
					<li>Evaluate the time it takes users to delete a playlist, a song from a playlist, a search session, a song from the player.</li>
					<li>Test if the terminology and the labels make the application easy and clear to use;</li>
					<li>Test the systems response time</li>	
					<li>Use the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/#references">References</a> to guide you in writing your objectives.</li>

		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>
			<b>1. </b>
			The user wants to clean up his playlists collection.</p>
			<p>
			<b>2. </b>
			To accomplish this, he accesses the application via his Google account. He enters his credentials in the login page.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>3. </b>
			After authentication, the main menu of the application is visible, including the "Playlist" section.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>4. </b>
			The user navigates to his first created playlist and decides to delete it, since his music taste has evolved.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>5. </b>
			He then picks another playlist and realizes that one of the songs does not go well with the rest of them. He deletes that song. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>6. </b>
			Because he wants his playlist to have a specific number of songs and he has deleted one, he picks another song from the playlist and searches for similar songs.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>7. </b>
			From the similar songs he adds one to the playlist, then deletes the created search session.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>8. </b>
			He plays the playlist.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>9. </b>
			He deletes from the player the first song.

				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<p>Write out the tasks for each persona type. <strong>Avoid complex tasks.</strong> Make sure the user is able to complete the test in the specified time interval. Assign an estimated completion time for each task.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authentication: <span>30 s</span>;</li>
						<li>Navigate to the first playlist and delete it <span>30 s</span>;</li>
						<li>Delete a song from a playlist: <span>10 s</span></li>
						<li>Search for a song similar to one from the previous playlist: <span>10 s</span></li>
						<li>Add a similar song from the results to the playlist: <span> 20 s </span></li>
						<li>Delete the created search session: <span>10 s</span></li>
						<li>Play the previously modified playlist: <span>10 s </span></li>
						<li>Delete from the player the first song: <span>10 s</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is a problem. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>			
					<ul>
						<li>Question 1: How easy was it for you to navigate through existing playlists?</li>
						<li>Question 2: Did you find the available tutorial helpful in performing this tasks?</li>
						<li>Question 3: Was the terminology understandable for you?</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

			<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is an issue with the design. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>

			<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
			<p>Before the test write down some expected answers to these questions in order to compare them with the user's answers. Another solution is to establish the expected answers by using a control user.</p>
