            <ul>
                <li>Assess the overall effectiveness of the <strong>U play3D application</strong> for users who are
                    interested in discovering new bands, organizing their discoveries into new playlists, listening to
                    music and sharing their findings with friends;
                </li>
                <li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>the creation of a new playlist, the addition of songs to
                    it, playing a playlist and sharing it</strong>;
                </li>
                <li>Have an evidence of the users that used the available Tutorial in order to do this task and ask them
                    if it was helpful;
                </li>
                <li>Evaluate the time it takes users to perform essential tasks such as playlist creation, songs
                    addition, playlist sharing and listening;
                </li>
                <li>Test if the terminology and the labels make the application easy and clear to use;</li>
                <li>Test the systems response time</li>

            <ol>
                <li>The user wants to search for a band that was recommended to him - "Imagine Dragons".</li>
                <li>To accomplish this, he accesses the application via his Google account. He enters his credentials in
                    the login page.
                </li>
                <li>After authentication, the main menu of the application is visible.</li>
                <li>The user searches for the "Imagine Dragons" band.</li>
                <li>He looks through the results and selects three songs from each search category which he adds to a
                    new playlist.
                </li>
                <li>After the playlist was completed, he starts listening to it.</li>
                <li>Realizing he really likes this new band, he decides to share this playlist with his friends on
                    Twitter.

                    <li>Question 1: How easy was it for you to search for a band?</li>
                    <li>Question 2: What did you think about the manner of presenting the search results? Anything you
                        would change about that?
                    </li>
                    <li>Question 3: How easy was it for you to navigate through the search result categories?</li>

                <h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they
                        are thinking, about the task or the product/application;
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
                    <li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
                        sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
                        Observations section accompanied by video/audio).
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
                        "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".
                    </li>

            <h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
            <h6>User 1</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Relatively easy, the only issue was how to reach the artist sub page.</li>
                <li>
                    The only confusing flow was how you search for items. You enter the search query on the right hand
                    side of the page, but you view the result in the left panel. Switching between the two can be
                    confusing.
                </li>
                <li>Relatively easy.</li>
                <li>
                    The only issue was how to add a new playlist from the song menu. The input for the playlist name
                    has no real indication that it creates a new playlist, which will be entitled according to the given input.
                </li>
                <li>It explained all the major tasks that had to be done.</li>
                <li>No terms were ambiguous.</li>
				<li>The system response time met the users aspectations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>User 2</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The input for the search query is hard to find. It was expected that the input would be centrally placed
                    where the rest of the search results are, and not somewhere on the right hand side.
                </li>
				<li>
				    Considering the amount of resulted information, the manner of presenting it is simple and not overwhelming.
				</li>
                <li>
                    The artist subsection of the search results was hard to find.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No issues met, especially with the arrow navigation feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was very helpful and had all the information needed to complete the tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The terminology used was clear and suggestive.
                </li>
				<li>
					Even when the search sessions number becomes considerable, the loading time of the search results is satisfactory. 
				</li>
            </ol>
			<h6>User 3</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Searching for any content was easy because the tutorial explained how such a task was supposed to be handled. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The aspects that brought confusion to the user are related to the secondary results which are hidden initially 
					and how to increase the number of visible secondary results. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigation was performed with ease.
                </li>
				<li>
				Adding songs to a playlist was extremely easy.
				</li>
                <li>
                    It contained essential information about the tasks that needed to be performed, but these pieces of information were
					presented at a fast pace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The used terminology was very understandable.
                </li>
				<li>
				    The systems response time raised to the users standards of acceptability.
				</li>
            </ol>
			<h6>User 4</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The user did not find the task of searching easy to perform. The problems surface from the way the search input area
					becomes visible and then disappears.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way of displaying the search results was satisfactory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The task of navigating through search categories was completed without encountering problems.
                </li>

            <h5>Test Observations</h5>

            <p>
                As for the previous tests, the users became more fluent with the general application workflow,
                being able to complete the tasks easily and with no external input. Most of the users completed the
                tasks before the allotted time, a testament to how accessible the learning curve of the application is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigating between the search result pages was the only setback for the users. Most of them had a hard
                time finding how to choose the correct sub-category of the search items, and what each individual
                related item list meant.

            <h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>

            <p>
                The users had no major difficulties completing the tasks, as they became more in tune with the
                application workflow. We feel that the initial hurdles for the users were caused by the poorly
                executed tutorial, and not the flow itself. We believe that if we improve how the tutorial is presented
                to the user, and make the information more accessible, we will mitigate all the initial problems
                that the users had.
            </p>
            <p>
                We should also investigate why the search categories were hard to find by the users. We should consider
                changing the layout of the four search categories to make them more apparent to the user.
