							of representing the connection between songs and artists. </li>

				<div class="leftGroup">

							main features of an application are and the degree of novelty it brings. </li>

						<li>He wants an alternative, faster, more suggestive way of showing relationships between songs and/or artists.</li>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<ul>
				<li> Eugen is a young, creative and communicative man, extremely passionate about music and constantly searching for innovative ways
					of exploring the vast domain. Having graduated the Jurnalism and Communication Science college, he is keen on observing the 
					impact music has on people and how interactions between humans can be affected both in a positive and negative manner by their music preferences.</li>
				<li> His interest in music and media was perceived from an early age. In highschool, he persuaded the principal to create and launch a school radio. 
					 He was mainly responsible for song selection, having to maintain a balance between what the pupils wanted to listen to and what was appropriate for the context.
					 In addition, he had the chance to be "on-air" several times, if there were any important announcements to be made. </li>
				<li> During college, he got a job at a local radio. This experience influenced him immensely. He learned about the format that a radio show has and how to structure
				 the playlist to be appealing to the targeted audience. He improved both professionally, by obtaining a set of technical skills and getting a better understanding of how the industry works, and personally, because
				 his confidence level increased every time he had to go on air to read the news. Moreover, he created a network of connections, which helped him get his current job. </li>	 
				<li> Working as a DJ for radio Guerrilla brought about bigger responsibilities. Apart from selecting the songs for the everyday playlist, Eugen has to stay informed about the latest music events and music apparition. One of the purposes of
					his show is to make music related recommandations for his listeners. It is higly important for Eugen that the content of his show maintains a certain level of quality and consistency. He receives many requests from different bands, but he prefers to 
					make discoveries on his own. To accomplish that, he searches through music applications that have a system of quantifying the popularity of a band or a song. He finds it annoying to keep making accounts when he doesn't usually use the personalized features. Another essential aspect for Eugen is 
					to have	a visual representation of the elements that may link bands or songs together. Creating a playlists is not a simple process, because there shouldn't be upsetting discrepancies between tracks, therefore, seeing the connections in a 3D manner simplifies his work.	
				</li>
				<li>
				Eugen is a sociable, outgoing person, who enjoys the company of his friends and is not affraid to try new things. Because of his work environment, he is a member of very artistic circles, which is very suitable for his creative nature and will 
				hopefully provide him with an endless source of inspiration for his book.
