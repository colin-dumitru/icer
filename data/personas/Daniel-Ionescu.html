				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Daniel Ionescu is a 51 year old engineer who has been working at Global Logistics for 25 years. He became an important asset for his company soon
					after being employed, his hard work and dedication being recognized at a very early stage by his co-workers. Although his English level is not
					advanced, he is able to communicate when necessary, after taking some courses. He started using a computer later in life and still finds it difficult
					to use certain features of different websites. </li>
					<li>During his student life, he was always passionate about music but he did not have the means to
					organize a collection it the way he wanted too, giving the lack of a computer and the difficulty to find the albums on the market. </li>
					<li>His tastes in music were well defined since childhood and still remembers the first concert he attended with his father in Germany. He was very influenced
					by that experience which led him to develop an appreciation for rock music.</li>
					<li>His favorite bands are Pink Floyd 
					and Led Zeppelin and he is proud to say he has imprinted his musical taste on his two children, Alexandra and Marius.</li>
					<li>Although his music preferences have not changed since college, he is open to discovering new artists, but does not always understand the new trends and 
					genres that are constantly appearing on the market.</li>
					<li>Daniel believes it is important to always have "smart" playlists at hand, suitable for every occasion and party. He likes to be in charge with the music
					at every gathering with friends and family.</li>
					<li>Daniel is also interested in concerts in Romania, not being able to travel that often to watch his favorite bands play abroad. He considers the music
					industry to be very important and he always wants to be informed about the latest events. In order to do that, he checks different websites of the bands, but would
					like to be able to have a single source of information.</li>
					<li>Besides being an engineer and a music passionate, he is also a husband to Ioana and has two children, who have always shared his interest in 
					the 80's, early 90's songs, calling them "oldies but goldies".</li>
