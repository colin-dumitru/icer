                <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dave is studying liberal arts in his first year at university, after being accepted to Williams
                        College in Washington. He isnâ€™t very interested in the courses he attends, and always brings a 
                        mobile device with him to use during lectures for activities such as listening to music, 
                        playing games or watching shorts. 
                    </li>
                    <li>He had always has an inclination for fine arts, and less so for science and related subjects,
                        especially computer science. His spare time is usually filled with related activities, such as
                        small design work, learning music composition or passive activities such as watching movies 
                        or listening to music. He also spends a great amount of time doing social activities with his friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>He is an average computer user, mostly using them for internet, movies, social media and music.
                        He owns three mobile devices, a 7-inch tablet which he uses occasionally, a mobile phone which
                        is his primary device for listening to music, and a laptop which he uses mostly for lectures at
                        university. He also owns a conventional desktop computer which he uses mostly for video games.
                        He was never interested in more advanced topics of IT, thus has remained at an average level, 
                        but he does know the basics of programming from a CS class he took during high school.
                    </li>
                    <li>He has always been interested in music, mostly just listening, but also learning the basis of a
                        few instruments, including guitar and ukulele. He first started listening to music on his own at
                        a very young age, during the era of cassette players and walkmans. He has then used a variety of
                        devices for listening to music including CD's, Ipod's, offline MP3's, and his current media of
                        choice, internet streaming radio. Even though he spends a great amount of time listening to music,
                        he currently has no plans to pursue a profession music career, only doing music composition on
                        his spare time from time to time.
                    </li>
                    <li>He is a very sociable person. He would rather participate in activities with his friends than on
                        his own. He especially enjoys sharing music with his friends, and receiving suggestions from
                        them. He mostly uses Facebook to link YouTube videos or share lyrics to his favourite songs.

        <div class="personaScenarios">
            <h5>Scenarios</h5>
            <li>Given that is an avid music consumer, he might use the software to find new music based on his listening

                <ol>
                    <li>Dave has listen for the past few days to the discography of a new band he has recently
                        discovered, and is interested in finding similar artists to the aforementioned band.

                <ol>
                    <li>Dave has created his own personalized playlist comprised of over 100 songs he has discovered
                        over the years, which he uses to study as it helps him relax.
                    </li>
                    <li>He would like to share this playlist to his friends, hopeful that it will be just as helpful for
                        them as it is for him.
                    </li>

                    <li>He clicks the share button for Facebook, and is redirected to a log-in page in which he enters
                        his credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li>After he logs in successfully to Facebook, a new message will be posted on his wall which will
                        redirect his users to the playlist and they can start listening to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Every friend receives a personalized copy of the playlist, and they can modify it as they
                        choose.
                    </li>

                    <li>Dave is currently listening to music on his desktop PC, while visiting Reddit just before
                        heading off to class.
                    </li>
                    <li>He pressed the pause button in Icer, and proceeds to shutdown his computer to leave for
                        university.
                    </li>
                    <li>He arrives at his lecture hall, and after connecting to his school Wi-Fi, he navigates to the Icer website.</li>
